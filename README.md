# NIKKE Portrait Swapper
A simple tool useful to mod [NIKKE](https://nikke-en.com/) bundles. Thanks to Bingle and Danieru for the help.


## Source code:

The .exe file is a SFX file created with WinRAR that contains all of the Python scripts and JSON files needed, it can be extracted with WinRAR/7Zip.


## Before to use this tool:

  - Download and install [.NET SDK 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-8.0.404-windows-x64-installer).
  - Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), along with all of the addons included (pip, etc).
  - Download and install [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe), and after that install the necessary libraries following [this video](https://files.catbox.moe/vqsuix.mp4).

  - Open a Windows PowerShell window as Admin, type: pip install UnityPy. And hit enter to install UnityPy for Python.
  - On the same PowerShell window type: pip install requests. Hit enter to install.



## Usage:

1. Double-click the exe file "DOROPortraitSwapper.exe". If the tool asks you to Run as Admin you must to allow it.
2. You will see the message "Write the character name to be swapped:", write the portrait that will be swapped. For my example I write Scarlet Black Shadow. Hit Enter.
3. You will see another message "Write the skin number for [character name]:", if you want to swap a default portrait you must to write 00, if it's a skin you must to write the corresponding number 01/02/03/04 etc. For my example I write 00 since it's default Scarlet Black Shadow. Hit Enter.
4. You will see another message "Write the character name you will use for the swap:", write the other character that will be used for the swap. For my example I write Scarlet Black Shadow again. Hit Enter.
5. You will see the message "Write the skin number for [character name]:" again, write the corresponding skin number you want. For my example I write 01 since I'm swapping Scarlet Black Shadow skin (01) over default Scarlet Black Shadow (00). Hit Enter.
6. Wait until the tool finishes to process stuff, you will see the message "Press enter to continue" three times so just hit Enter until the Terminal window continues with the process.
7. If everything worked you will see the swapped portrait files saved on your Desktop in a new folder named "PORTRAIT_SWAPPED".
8. Move those files from that folder "PORTRAIT_SWAPPED" to your "mods" folder located in your NMM folder.



Apply the mods with NMM and that's it, happy modding! ^â€¿^
